# Health-Recommendation-System
🌟 Intelligent Disease Prediction and Health Recommendation System with Python and Machine Learning! 🌟

I'm excited to introduce my latest project, a Disease Prediction Model that uses a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and integrates a personalized recommendation engine to empower users with proactive health guidance! 🩺💻

Project Features:

1️⃣ Disease Prediction with SVC: By training an SVC model with a linear kernel on symptom-based data, this system predicts possible diseases from user input, aiming for accuracy and reliability in healthcare support.

2️⃣ Model Persistence for Deployment: To make deployment seamless, the model is saved and loaded using pickle, enhancing reusability and scalability in real-world applications.

3️⃣ Personalized Health Recommendations: For each predicted disease, users receive:

A description of the condition 📝
Precautions to consider ⚠️
Medication guidance 💊
Relevant workout routines 🏋️
Suggested dietary plans 🍏
This integrated prediction-recommendation model is designed not only to identify potential conditions but also to support users in making informed, actionable health decisions tailored to their needs.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can offer meaningful insights and accessible healthcare improvements, bringing AI’s potential to real-world health applications. 🚀
